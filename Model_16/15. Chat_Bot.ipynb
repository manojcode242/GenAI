According to the information provided, DeepSeek launched the DeepSeek chatbot \"DeepSeek (chatbot)\" on January 20, 2025, which was based on the DeepSeek-R1 model. This chatbot became the most downloaded freeware app on the iOS App Store in the United States, surpassing ChatGPT, and triggered an 18% drop in Nvidia's share price.\n","\n","Additionally, the output mentions that DeepSeek released several versions of its model, including DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V2.5, and DeepSeek-V3, with the latter being released in March 2025. The output also mentions that the DeepSeek-R1 model was released under the MIT License in January 2025.\n","\n","It's worth noting that the output provides a detailed breakdown of the events surrounding the launch of DeepSeek LLN, including the impact it had on the global market and the technology industry.\n","User: is the model good compared to chatgpt\n","Assistant: Based on the output from the tool call, it appears that the DeepSeek-R1 model outperformed LLaMA 3.1 and QWEN 2.5, while matching GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in benchmark tests. This suggests that the DeepSeek-R1 model is competitive with other large language models, including ChatGPT.\n","\n","However, it's important to note that the output does not provide a direct comparison between DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT. The output only mentions that DeepSeek-R1 surpassed ChatGPT in terms of downloads on the iOS App Store, but it does not provide information on the performance or capabilities of the two models.\n","\n","To provide a more comprehensive comparison, additional information would be needed, such as benchmark test results, evaluation metrics, or user reviews.\n","User: q\n","Goodbye!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"I_RCQ7xRASCQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
